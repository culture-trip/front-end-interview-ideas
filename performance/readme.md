# Performance task

Show the waterfall graph.

## HTML
The blue HTML bar has two sections - 

1. the pale blue half is the time taken for the server to get the page ready to send back to the browser.
- if the server takes a long time to get the page ready, what might be a possible cause? How could this be sped up?
2. the darker blue half is the time to download the HTML to the browser
- how could this be made quicker?

## CSS
The green bar is a CSS file, linked from the HTML
- how could we get the CSS to load quicker, so the user sees the content sooner?

## JS
The red bar is a Javascript file, linked from the HTML
- the page won't become interactive until the JS has downloaded and executed. What are some ways that we could speed this up?
